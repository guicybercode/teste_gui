                <h2>Faith</h2>
                <p>My faith in Christ comes first in my life. It is the foundation of everything I do, guiding my decisions, shaping my relationships, and influencing how I view my work and creativity.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Romans 8:37</strong></p>
                    <p>"No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us."</p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5rem;">"Não, em todas estas coisas somos mais que vencedores, por meio daquele que nos amou."</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>I serve as a <strong>church guitarist</strong>, using my musical gifts to worship and lead others in praise. Music and faith are deeply intertwined in my life—each note I play is an expression of gratitude and devotion to God.</p>
                
                <p>My Christian faith is not just a part of who I am—it is the core of my identity. It gives me purpose, strength, and hope, and it's the lens through which I see the world and my place in it.</p>
